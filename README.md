Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that helps their customers with financial plans. The company wanted to be able to protect their clients information. 

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
What I did well was finding the client's security vulnerabilities with maven dependency check. It is important to code securely to prevent hacking. It is better to take action to prevent exposing customer's information than taking action to fix the issue as a company which can lead to lawsuits or loss of business. 

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
What was challenging for me was implementing the checksum verification due to my program not loading correctly. In the future, I would do more research to do things correctly.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I made certain that the code and software were functional and secure by continuously running the software until it ran successfully. In addition, continiously check the vulnerabilities to make sure there were no new vulnerabiltiies. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show future employrs the knowledge I have in securing code.
